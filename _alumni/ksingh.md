Kirat, our esteemed electrical team captain, has played a vital role as one of the pioneers in shaping the electrical team of Team 2204. His expertise spans from mastering simple wire connections to advanced skills such as crimping and pneumatics, making him a comprehensive resource for all things related to the robot’s electrical systems. In the fall, Kirat took the initiative to host electrical workshops, passing on his knowledge and skills to a new generation of enthusiastic electrical team members. Moreover, his exceptional proficiency with drills and impact drivers has earned him a reputation as one of the best in the field. Team 2204 will certainly miss his ability to precisely and swiftly drill holes into pieces of wood or metal. Kirat’s contributions have left an indelible mark on the team, and his absence will be felt
