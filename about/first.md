## Introduction to the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)

The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an exciting program that challenges high school students to design, build, and program robots to compete in a game that changes every year. Founded in 1992, FRC combines the excitement of a varsity sport with the rigor of science and technology, promoting critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork.

Each year, FRC releases a new game that requires teams to build a robot that can perform specific tasks. Teams have six weeks to design, build, and program their robot before competing in regional events. The competitions are held in arenas where teams compete head-to-head to complete the game's objectives.

Through participation in FRC, students develop essential life skills such as leadership, communication, and problem-solving, which can benefit them both academically and professionally. FRC provides a unique and exciting opportunity for students to apply their knowledge in a real-world setting and develop valuable skills that will serve them well in the future.
