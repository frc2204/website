**Team 2204 “The RamBots”** is a high school FIRST Robotics team located in the San Francisco Bay Area. We give opportunities for students to build up skills and knowledge in science and technology through engineering and partnerships with the community.

> "FIRST is more than robots. The robots are a vehicle for students to learn important life skills. Kids often come in not knowing what to expect- of the program or of themselves. They leave, even after the first season, with a vision, with confidence, and with a sense that they can create their own future." <br>**- Dean Kamen, Co-Founder of FIRST**
