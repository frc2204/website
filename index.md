Located in Hayward, California, the **2204 Rambots** is a FIRST Robotics team that gives opportunities for students to build
up skills and knowledge in science and technology through engineering and partnerships with the community.

> "First is more than robots. The robots are a vehicle for students to learn important life skills. Kids often come in not knowing what to expect- of the program or of themselves. They leave, even after the first season, with a vision, with confidence, and with a sense that they can create their own future. -Dean Kamen"
