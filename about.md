We are a high school robotics team that competes in a prestigious annual robotics competition held by the FIRST 
organization. The build season lasts 6 weeks, and in that time, we apply our math, science, and engineering knowledge to build a fully-functioning robot.

# Established 2010
Originating in San Leandro, Team 2204 was established by students who sought to inspire others in STEM fields and build engineering skills that would last a lifetime. The 2010 Breakaway Challenge was the beginning of a team that would make its mark in the community and students’ lives.

The mission of [FIRST®][first] is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders and innovators, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.
