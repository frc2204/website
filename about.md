We are a high school robotics team that competes in a prestigious annual robotics competition held by the FIRST
organization. The build season lasts 6 weeks, and in that time, we apply our math, science, and engineering knowledge to build a fully-functioning robot.

The mission of [FIRST®][first] is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders and innovators, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.

## Awards

# 2023 Creativity Award sponsored by Rockwell Automation

The Creativity Award celebrates creativity that enhances strategy of play and was intentionally designed and not discovered.

> "The Creativity Award sponsored by Rockwell Automation celebrates creativity that enhances strategy of play and was intentionally designed and not discovered. When ramming the cube didn't work, this team had to get a grip. Their flexible claw provided a universal fit when it comes to creativity, this definitely commits. Congratulations Team 2204!"

# 2023 Dean’s List Semi-Finalist

The students who earn FIRST Dean’s List Award status as a Semi-Finalists, Finalist or Winner, are great examples of student leaders who have led their Teams and communities to increased awareness for FIRST and its mission. These students have also achieved personal technical expertise and accomplishment. It is the intention of FIRST that these individuals will continue on, post-Award, as great leaders, student alumni, and advocates of FIRST.

Our team captain, James Ding, was nominated for the Dean's List award at the 2023 Sacramento Regional, being one of the top 5 students nominated by their respective teams in the competition.

# 2020 Woodie Flowers Mentor Award (Gary Gin)

The Woodie Flowers Award celebrates effective communication in the art and science of engineering and design. Dr. William Murphy founded this prestigious award in 1996 to recognize mentors within the FIRST Robotics Competition who lead, inspire, and empower using excellent communication skills.

Our mentor, Gary Gin, won this award at the 2020: Infinite Recharge competition. He was nominated by our team and won the award for his dedication to the team and his ability to inspire others.

## History

Originating in San Leandro, The Rambots was established in 2007, led by Joni Carlson, a science teacher at Chinese Christian Schools who sought to inspire students intrested in **STEM** _(science, technology, engineering, and mathematics)_ fields and build engineering skills that would last a lifetime. Since then, the school has moved to Hayward and provides students with a chance to pursue their interests in STEM.
