Registration to join the team is now open for the 2023-2024 season! Students enrolled at California Crosspoint High School and Redwood Christian High School are eligible to join the team.

**No prior experience or knowledge is required. All knowledge will be taught to members during pre-season.**

The team is entirely student-led, with help from our experienced [mentors](/members#mentors) and teachers. The season begins in early January and ends mid-March. However, students are expected to attend pre-season meetings and workshops. During the season, you can expect **~23 hours of meetings every week**. Members must be able to **attend a minimum 70% of all meetings (~16 hours)**.

During each season, which falls between March and April, our team anticipates participating in 2-3 of the following competitions:

- [Sacramento Regional at UC Davis](https://cafirst.org/frc/sacramento/)
- [Silicon Valley Regional at San Jose State University](https://cafirst.org/frc/siliconvalley/) and/or the [San Francisco Regional](https://cafirst.org/frc/sanfrancisco/)

#### Costs

The cost to join the team is $400, which covers the cost of team registration, materials, tools, and other expenses. However, we do not want the fee to be a barrier to entry, so we offer financial assistance to waive the fee for students who need it. If you need financial aid, please reach out to one of the mentors.

## Subteams

Our team has 5 subteams you can join.

### Fabrication and Design

The fabrication team is responsible for translating creative concepts and engineering specifications into tangible and functional robot components. This team's role involves brainstorming innovative ideas, generating detailed design plans, and utilizing CAD software ([Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview)) to develop a functional and efficient robot. They also employ a diverse range of skills, including metalworking, machining, 3D printing, and more, to create precise and functional robot parts. This team collaborates closely with other subteams to analyze game challenges, brainstorm innovative solutions, and design intricate mechanical and structural elements that align with the team's strategic goals.

### Electrical

The electrical subteam is tasked with designing, building, and maintaining the electrical systems of the robot, ensuring its reliable operation during competitions. This involves selecting and integrating various components such as motors, sensors, controllers, and power distribution mechanisms, while also developing the wiring layout and circuitry. The team collaborates closely with other subteams to ensure seamless integration of electrical systems with mechanical and software components, aiming to create a high-performance robot that can successfully complete tasks in the competition. Additionally, the electrical subteam often engages in troubleshooting, debugging, and optimizing the robot's electrical systems to maximize its efficiency and effectiveness on the field.

### Programming

The programming subteam is responsible for designing, developing, and implementing the software systems that control the robot's behavior and functionality. They collaborate closely with other subteams to translate the mechanical and electrical aspects of the robot into intelligible code, enabling autonomous and remote-controlled operations. Currently, the team uses the programming language [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib) to control the robot and all its functionality. Their work is essential in ensuring the robot's precision, efficiency, and responsiveness during competitions, fostering innovation and problem-solving through cutting-edge software solutions.

The programming team lead this season is [Jay Yu](/leadership/jyu) and [Winnie Zhao](/leadership/wzhao)

### Business

The business subteam is responsible for managing the non-technical aspects of the team's operations, focusing on fundraising, applying for grants, sponsor relations, public relations, marketing, budgeting, event coordination, and community outreach. Their primary goal is to secure financial support through sponsorships and grants, organize promotional campaigns to enhance the team's visibility, plan and execute events to engage the community, handle budget allocation for various team needs, and establish a positive team image through effective communication strategies. By efficiently handling these business-oriented responsibilities, the business team ensures the overall sustainability and success of the team's endeavors.

The business team lead this season is [Brian Ding](/leadership/bding) and [Aiden Lee](/leadership/alee)
