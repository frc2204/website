Registration to join the team is now open for the 2022-2023 season! Students enrolled at California Crosspoint High 
School and Redwood Christian High School are eligible to join the team. 

The fee to join the team is $500, which covers the cost of materials, tools, and other expenses. However, we do not
want the fee to be a barrier to entry, so we offer financial assistance to waive the fee for students who need it. If 
you need financial aid, please let one of the mentors know.
