Hi all, 

We are excited to announce that our application for the 2023-2024 season is now open! We are looking for students who are interested in robotics and want to learn more about STEM. No prior experience is required, and we welcome all students to apply.

If you were not able to attend the interest meeting in person, look at the [slides](https://go.rambots.org/2023-interest-meeting-slides) for more information about the team and the application process.

The application can be found [here](https://go.rambots.org/application). The deadline to apply is **Monday, September 18th at 11:59 PM**.

Looking forward to meet you all!
