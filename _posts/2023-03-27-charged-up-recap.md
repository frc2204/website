## Accomplishments

We won the creativity award for our TPU claw idea/design! We’ll try to have business team turn that into a potential sponsorship from Bambu Labs?

## Rank

Rank 21/46 with a 6-4-0 record. Though were weren’t selected for playoffs, we were backup #2 and were almost selected to fill in for Finals #2.

Team 2204 currently ranks 1249/3306 worldwide, 1087/2694 nationally, and 111/270 state-wide. We were holding top 15 for more than half the time in qualifications though

## Fails

We had a bit of fails during competition - from bumpers falling off to discovering that a shaft key just never existed within our gearbox. Definitely a fun yet valuable experience for the build team members.
