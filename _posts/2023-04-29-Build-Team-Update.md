# 4/29/23 Build Team Update

## Accomplishments and Roadblocks

### Electrical Team
```Electrical team learned to use the software (CTRE) for the Falcon 500’s and how to rig up and operate a pneumatics system manually. Additionally, they experimented with playing tones with the Falcon 500’s, and adjusting the PID values with REV Client. Electrical also touched basic programing through WPILib.```

### Creativity Award
```During the past week, the fabrication team worked on cutting and preparing the acrylic pieces for the trophy. On the Saturday meeting, we experimented with polishing both the acrylic and polycarbonate pieces of the trophy. We also finished Mr. Gin’s trophy.```

## Next Steps
```As school wraps up, we’ll finish up the trophies and have them ready hopefully before the first summer meeting. As for meetings during the summer, what schedule would work for mentors? Leadership was thinking of having 2-3 meetings a week, with one probably during Saturday. Let us know what times would work for you during the summer.```

```Also during the summer we’ll probably tear everything out of the workshop to reorganize, we’ll talk to facilities about the logistics.```

```Thank you mentors for your dedication towards the team this year.```
