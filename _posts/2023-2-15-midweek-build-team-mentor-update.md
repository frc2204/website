# Accomplishments and Road Blocks

## Electrical

The electrical team has completed crimping all the Falcon 500 motors for the swerve drive and has begun to solder the CANCoders. Challenges were encountered in the through-hole soldering process, indicating that more practice is necessary.

## Fabrication

The team is awaiting the 32T and 42T aluminum gears from WCP, but Mr. Sam has 3D printed temporary replacements to enable assembly of the swerve drives. One swerve module has been assembled and all the treads have been cut. The 2x1 (from Rev Robotics) has been cut to 20‚Äù per piece and filed to ensure it fits onto the edge of the modules.

## CAD

After a design talk between Mr. Gin and Mr. Sam, the CAD models for the first and second joints have been completed. Mr. Sam raised the possibility of the arm and claw being incompatible, so redesign of the claw may be necessary. Photos, renders, and the F3D file are attached.

## Programming

Programming has completed a Limelight wrapper with unit tests, as well as proving the use cases of AprilTag MegaTagging for field localization and odometry. They are currently researching the meanings of and how to use SolvePnP values (x, y, z, rx, ry, rz). The code is available at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FRC2204-Rambots/frc-2023).

# Next Steps

The team plans to assemble the swerve drive completely by the end of Wednesday, and possibly have it running by Friday. Once the gears arrive, they will reassemble the swerve modules to fit them. Electrical needs to improve soldering skills and fix existing connections. CAD plans to finalize the design by the weekend and order parts from McMaster Carr. Programming requires the swerve chassis to be built before PID values can be tuned and driver training can begin.

# Shipping Updates (from Mr. Chen)

AndyMark bumper material, crimping tool, connectors, and rectangle tube have been shipped and are expected to arrive on Friday, February 17th. RoboPromo Bumper Numbers have been shipped and are expected to arrive on Saturday, February 18th, or Monday if the school has a hold on weekend deliveries.
