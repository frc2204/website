## Electrical

Successfully finished soldering the CANCoders and placing them in the swerve modules

## Fabrication

Finished assembling the chassis. Hooray.

## CAD

Finished designing second joint. Mr. Sam helped point the design team towards a 5/8‚Äù hub for the arm from McMaster-Carr.

## Programming

Attendance programming has been started while the rest of build teams focuses on wrapping up the drive train.

# Next Steps/Saturday Briefing

After assembling the chassis, electrical plans to build a temporary board and wire everything together. Fabrication will ensure that the swerve is functioning properly (greasing up everything, etc.). Once electrical gives the go-ahead, programming will begin tuning the swerve drive, which includes PID profiling and running a maximum speed test. By the end of Saturday, it is the goal to have the swerve drive fully operational.

For design, the CAD will need input from Mr. Gin and other mentors before fabrication for the main parts can begin. James will contact Mr. Gin to arrange a time for the fabrication.

5 more weeks until competition. Thank you mentors for your hard work and dedication towards the team.
