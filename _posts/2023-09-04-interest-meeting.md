Thanks for expressing your interest in FIRST Robotics during last weeks club fair! We are really excited about the start of the new season this year. We will be having our very first all-team meeting **THIS WEDNESDAY (9/6) during lunch** most likely in **ROOM 204**. This meeting will go through what FIRST is about, different sub-teams, what we do as a team, and the upcoming schedule. Please don't hesitate to reach out to leadership if you have any questions. We can't wait to see you guys there :D
